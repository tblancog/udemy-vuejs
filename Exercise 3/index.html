      <h3>1) Show a "result" of 'not there yet' as long as "value" is not equal to 37
        - you can change "value" with the buttons. Print 'done' once you did it</h3>
      <p>I computed the property result with a callback function that checks the
        value if it's not equal to 37, print "Not yet" else "Done"</p>
      <div>
          <p>Current Value: {‌{ value }}</p>
          <button @click="value += 5">Add 5</button>
          <button @click="value += 1">Add 1</button>
          <p>{‌{ result }}</p>
      </div>

      <h3>2) Watch for changes in the "result" and reset the "value"
        after 5 seconds (hint: setTimeout(..., 5000)</h3>
        <p>Watched result property and setTimeout for each 5000 miliseconds to set the value
          property to 0, but before doing so I had to assign the actual context (this) to a var vm
          so I could change value attribute. I wasn't clear enough on how to do this, any feedback
          would be greatly appreciated.
